That is, everything you should have received a grade for.  Then you'll need to show me you know how to navigate the JSON in that file.\n",

As I am from non-coding background I was afraid of this subject but professor made it easy by providing different types of examples, inclass assignments and rectifying my doubts with my friends and professor. when it comes with this week assignments I felt it was bit difficult but I tried it well. Almost in each and every assignment i have learned a new things like how to write a list or a dictionary. Mainly this coding subject made me to think in a broad and diverse way, like incresing my patience level, i mean in a way that, how i handle the assertion errors and syntax errors. Finally thank you so much for explaining the topis in easier way. I really like the way how you explain the doubts to individual persons in the class."
